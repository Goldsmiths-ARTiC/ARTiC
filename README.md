ARTiC
=====

This project started as a...

A LLVM backend for creation of APK files.  

A Goldsmitsh University project (Computer Games and Entertainment MSc) to create a alternative toolchain for compliation 
and use of C++ on Android. 

Using ARTiC will be partway a backend for the LLVM compiler using IR files as an intermediate, will compile the IR
file for ART systems, and create the minimum java manifest necessary for ART to run the native code. 

But it has evolved to be a...

C++ code visualizer built with LLVM and Clang. 

This is an educational tool that will help people without knowledge of C++ to give their first steps into this programming language. It will show them news and different ways to visualize C++ code, helping them to understand programming.
